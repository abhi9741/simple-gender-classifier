This This is the code for the gender classification . The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body measurements (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.
This uses FIT method from Deccision tree of scikit module.
The data used is generated by me (i.e, its noth the correct data), and since this is my first project i only used 11 sets of measurements as data .
